# 3D-Data-Processing
Different programs implemented for the 3D Data Processing course

Each homework tackles a different popular task concerning 3D Data, the first three were implemented using C++ meanwhile the last one consists in a Jupyter Notebook. In both cases, the OpenCV library has been used.



-In Homework 3 an implementation of the classic ICP registration has been implemented. The initial transformation between the Point Clouds was not given, so in order to obtain good initial matches a descriptor based approach was implemented. The descriptor used in this case was the FPFH.

-In Homework 4 the PointNet architecture has been modified in order to retrieve a low dimensional descriptor of a 3D Point Cloud, which is then used in order to classify it.
